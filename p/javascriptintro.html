            JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites.
             While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.
            JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. 
            This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. For example, a JavaScript function may check a web
            form before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.
